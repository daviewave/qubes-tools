1, clone debian-12-xfce 
2, updated gui settings before starting
    -> (basic) color (purple for templates)
    -> (basic) priv main:128Gib && storage:4Gib
    -> (adv) memory balancing: DISABLED
    -> (adv) memory: 120000MiB
    -> (adv) VCPUs: 7
3, started new vm opening an xfce terminal
4, copied setup tools from dom0 # NOTE TO SELF: fixed error in 2nd script
5, from within templatevm mv tools from default transfer location to /opt
6, moved to setup tools dir and exported an environ var as $PWD for easier navigation, then moved to scripts dir
7, ran 1 script which failed because template vms are not connected to the internet unless proxy vars that 
    redirect to designated proxyvm -- moved the script i have for this into dir for future use
8, successfully re-ran 1st script cloning builder repo after starting proxyvm (copied with desired user:user ownership)
9, had a good idea of setting more general paths in the env.sh script to make cleaner and reduce chance of error
10, lots of changes but wanted to remind myself that i added proxychains + wget when trying to figure out how to proxy gpg keyservers
	-> NOTE: pretty sure i can safely remove proxychains




#== additional pkgs ==#
- wget
- proxychains4 
  --> new config file in conf
